Add monolith to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:\r\n\r\n```ex\r\ndef deps do\r\n  [{:monolith, github: \"NobbZ/monolith\", branch: \"master\"}]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Ensure monolith is started before your application:\r\n\r\n```ex\r\ndef application do\r\n  [applications: [:monolith]]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Pull and compile the newly added dependencies: `mix do deps.get, deps.compile`\r\n\r\n## Projects using `monolith`\r\n\r\nNone I'm aware of so far.\r\n\r\n[hex]: https://hex.pm/\r\n",
